## WavePool

An interactive application that teaches students about wavelengths, frequencies, and amplitude through gesture. In our demo here, we created an experience where students learn how the length of a wave defines its frequency. By changing the distance between their hands, and in turn the wavelength, the frequency that they hear changes.

## How to use this repo

At this time, this repo may not be that useful for those interested in building upon our work.  In future iterations we hope to solve that issue.  To view our presentation, go to:

WebAudioApi/  -HTML5 demo using web audio api to demonstrate pitch and wavelength

max-msp/  -Contains Max patch we used to create the sound playback engine in our preso

preso/  -Contains the source code for our preso at the Edesign Lab Hackathon 2013. Uses requre.js

## Future iterations

Future iterations will incorporate the following:

* Complex sound waves: Students can collaborate bringing their different sound waves together projected on a screen. While understanding their unique roll, they can have a playful experience. Complex sound waves are built from a variety of simple waves.

    * Filters: Students can collaborate to form filter bands with their bodies. By moving forward and backward they can isolate bands within the spectrum.

    * Melodies: Using number theory and distance, students can experiment with pitches along the 12 tone scale to create melodies.
